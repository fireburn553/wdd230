                <h3>Bagasbas Beach</h3>
                <p>According to EAZY TRAVELER, <br><q cite="https://eazytraveler.net/2013/12/daet-camarines-norte-surfing-in-bagasbas-beach/">Bagasbas Beach in Daet, Camarines Norte is one of the top surfing spots in the Philippines. This brown-sand beach break is a safe place for both novice and experienced surfers alike. A boulevard lined with guesthouses, restaurants and KTV bars (actually, the next best thing to do here besides surfing is karaoke!) runs along the length of Bagasbas Beach. Kalesas or horse-drawn take tourists for a ride up and down this avenue. The beach itself wasn’t white-sand pretty at all, but at least it was quiet and clean. And, most importantly. I had it all to myself!</q></p>
